### 🚀 About me
🎓   I'm a dedicated student pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, and I expect to graduate in 2026.
💻   I first became interested in coding during my high school years, and I've been committed ever since.
🎨   I am passionate about CSS and general web design. My true passion is creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
